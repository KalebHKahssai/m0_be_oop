# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

  + This final CFU was definitely the most challenging and daunting. I felt weary doing outside research because I didn't know if it was a "good resource" or even at times what to look up. I feel I need to get better on how to learn using outside resources outside of my small group. I gave it my best shot, but I definitely need to do more reviewing and practice. I was a bit taken back how much "stuff" I felt was not included in the lesson, had to figure out, but at the same time realized that was with intention.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

  + Since I’ve started mod0, I’ve been using the Pomodoro Technique which I’ve seen good results from. I’ve been doing 60/15 blocks, every hour I take a 15 minute break where I step away from the computer to take a walk outside.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

 +  I think I will need to preview intense technical lessons and challenges like this ahead of time so I am not feeling overwhelmed. More importantly, I need to improve on how I can connect and visualize concepts together. Especially, as we go into more complex problems and concepts.
